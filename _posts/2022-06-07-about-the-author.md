Hello everyone! My name is Fyodor, pronounced the same as the name of Fyodor Dostoevsky, if you know who it is :)
I have been studying machine learning since September 2021, successfully completed the Tinkoff Generation course (the educational platform of a huge bank in Russia). I wanted to translate the textbook from the School of Data Analysis, as I did not find in the English-language Internet such a deep source as this one. Hope this helps someone. Good luck!
